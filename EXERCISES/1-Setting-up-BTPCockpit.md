# Setup SAP BTP Cockpit 

In this section, we will be setting up your BTP Cockpit to allow for connectivity with **AI Launchpad, Document Extraction, SAP HANA Cloud and S3 Object Store.** Thereafter we will proceed to modify the sample_env.txt file with the required keys. 

## STEP 1: Open SAP Business Technology Platform

ðŸ‘‰ Open SAP [BTP Cockpit](https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit).

ðŸ‘‰ Navigate to your subaccount. If creating a new subaccount, ensure region chosen allows provisioning of all pre-requisite services. [View Regions to see more](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/regions).

## STEP 2: Open SAP AI Launchpad and connect to SAP AI Core

ðŸ‘‰ Go to Instances and Subscriptions.

Check whether you see an SAP AI Core service instance and an SAP AI Launchpad application subscription. Ensure your AI Core service instance runs on the ``extended`` plan to access capailities of Generative AI Hub.

> SAP AI Launchpad is a centralised platform for AI lifecycle managemenet. We will be using it to deploy our LLM models for chunking and embedding conversion. 

ðŸ‘‰ If you haven't created an AI Core instance, go to Service Marketplace and search for SAP AI Core -> Click Create, choose ``extended`` plan, Cloud Foundry runtime environment and give it an instance name. -> Create instance
